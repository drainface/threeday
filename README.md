WELL!
My first attempt at writing a script, basically just by subbing my own directions into somebody elses.

add a 2 to former email address if you've forgotten and need to get back in.

Here's hoping that this goes off without a hitch, will try adding support for the snowman and stomping boots
Thinking I might add a warbear cooker to my work shed to get 2 charming flans and 2 unbearable lights...but really until i'm actually on the cusp of getting 2 day runs in i'm not gonna tweak too hard.

In fact i'm going to try the unaltered script tomorrow and leave it alone for the time being if it does net me 3 days, suboptimal or not i'm happy with no aftercore and no extra assets at the end as long as i get the 3 days in.
